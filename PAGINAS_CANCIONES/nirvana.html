                    Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
                    Sometimes I feel like giving up
                    But I just can't
                    It isn't in my blood

                    Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
                    I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
                    I could take to ease my mind slowly
                    Just have a drink and you'll feel better
                    Just take her home and you'll feel better
                    Keep telling me that it gets better
                    Does it ever?
