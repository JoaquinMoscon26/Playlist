                    If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
                    And I can take you for a ride
                    I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
                    Where the music don't stop for life
                    Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
                    Shining just the way I like
                    If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
                    You met me at the perfect time
                </p>

                    You want me, I want you, baby
                    My sugarboo, I'm levitating
                    The Milky Way, we're renegading
                    Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

                    I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
                    I need you all night, come on, dance with me
                    I'm levitating
                    You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
                    I need you all night, come on, dance with me

                <p class="parrafo">
                    I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
                    I see us written in the stars
                    We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
                    Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
                    Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
                    Shining just the way we are
                    I feel like we're forever every time we get together
                    But whatever, let's get lost on Mars
